    Initializes BlackBoard with the corresponding parameters.
    
    :param int port: The port through which BlackBoard will communicate with this module.
    :param dictionary functionMap: A dictionary containing **key:value** pairs, where the *key* is the name of a command received (a string),
        and the *value* is either a tuple containing a function as a first element and a boolean as a second element, or a function.
        The function in both cases is the function that is going to execute the specified command and receives on object of type :class:`Command` (See :ref:`Creating a command handler <creating_a_command_handler>`).
        The boolean value indicates whether the execution of that command should be synchronous (on the same thread) or asynchronous,
        usually synchronous execution is preferred for fast commands that can answer almost immediately and asynchronous for commands that might take a little time.
        When the value is only a function, by default the execution is synchronous. *functionMap* can also contain an entry with a string containing only an asterisk,
        meaning that would be the handler in case no other handler is found for a specific command.
        
        .. note::

            Notice that although functionMap can include a wildcard handler and this might seem like the module could answer
            anything, BlackBoard will only send commands that are registered under this module's configuration.
        
    :param function asyncHandler: A function that would handle the response of commands when sent with the method :func:`Send`
        instead of using :func:`SendAndWait`. This means the execution of a program that sends a command could continue
        and an asynchronous handler would handle the response when one is received.

        .. note::
    
            Notice that the asyncHandler functionality could also be achieved using a :class:`ParallelSender` object,
            but it has other implications.
