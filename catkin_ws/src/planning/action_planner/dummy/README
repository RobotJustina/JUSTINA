The action_planner package has the following dependencies

	arms
	base_ctrl
	bbros_bridge
	head
	language_understanding
	mvn_pln
	roah_rsbb_comm_ros
	vision

Since without those dependencies it cannot be built,
required files (messages and services) are located in this
directory. If required service files are not found during compilation,
they will be copied to the action_planner package's parent folder 
preserving directory structure.
