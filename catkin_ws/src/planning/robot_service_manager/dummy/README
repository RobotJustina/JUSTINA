The task_planner package has the following dependencies

	bbros_bridge
	language_understanding
	hri_msgs

Since without those dependencies it cannot be built,
required files (messages and services) are located in this
directory. If required service files are not found during compilation,
they will be copied to the action_planner package's parent folder 
preserving directory structure.
